LCHS Red Cross Club — Domain Management Guide
==================================================

Purpose
-------
This guide explains how to manage and renew the club’s custom domain
(e.g., www.lchsredcross.org) so that the website remains live year after year.

Registrar Choice
----------------
We recommend using **Porkbun** or **Cloudflare Registrar** for stability and low renewal costs.
- Porkbun: ~$11/year renewal
- Cloudflare: ~$10/year renewal
- GoDaddy is *not recommended* — cheap first-year promos but renewals cost $20–25+.

Registrar Account
-----------------
• Register the domain under the **club Gmail account** (not a personal email).  
• Club Gmail: lchsredcrossclub@gmail.com  
• This ensures that future officers can reset passwords and manage billing.

Billing & Renewal
-----------------
• Enable **auto-renew** in the registrar settings.  
• Connect a **club debit card**, prepaid card, or advisor’s card (with reimbursement).  
• Renewal is around $10–11 per year.  
• If possible, pay for **3–10 years upfront** to prevent lapses.

How to Configure Domain with GitHub Pages
-----------------------------------------
1. In the registrar’s DNS settings:
   - Add a CNAME record: Host = www, Value = <org>.github.io
     Example: lchs-red-cross-club.github.io
   - For the root domain (lchsredcross.org without www):
     - If supported, add ALIAS/ANAME → www.lchsredcross.org
     - Otherwise, set a URL redirect to https://www.lchsredcross.org

2. In GitHub:
   - Repo → Settings → Pages → Custom domain = www.lchsredcross.org
   - Save, then check "Enforce HTTPS"

3. In the repo root, ensure a file named CNAME exists with:
   www.lchsredcross.org

Handover Process
----------------
At the start of each school year:
[ ] Verify the domain is active and resolves correctly  
[ ] Confirm billing info is still valid  
[ ] Check that auto-renew is enabled  
[ ] Make sure the club Gmail account is accessible  
[ ] Document renewal date and cost in the Web Team README  

Contingency Plan
----------------
If the domain expires accidentally:
• Log into the registrar account with club Gmail  
• Renew the domain manually (can take up to 24 hours to restore)  
• If lost completely, re-purchase as soon as possible
